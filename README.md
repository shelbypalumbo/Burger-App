## User Story
As an avid burger consumer, I want the ability to log every burger I want to consume and check them off of my list as they are consumed, so that I can easily keep track of my vast burger resume!

Users of the Burger-App have the ability to removed a burger from either list, add a new burger to the "Saved Burgers!" list, as well as move burgers from "Saved Burgers!" to "Burgers Devoured!" and vice versa.
